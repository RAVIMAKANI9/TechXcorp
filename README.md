## 🧱 Bootstrap Components Used

The following Bootstrap 5 components and utilities were remixed and customized:

- **Navbar** — Responsive and sticky-top with smooth toggler  
- **Hero Section** — Carousel layout with image slider and headline text  
- **Cards** — Used for features, services, and information blocks

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Development Process

### 1. Research & Exploration
- Explored **Bootstrap 5 official examples** such as:  
  - [Carousel Example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/carousel/)  
  - [Features Example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/features/)  
  - [Navbar Example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/navbars/)
- Identified components suitable for remixing (navbars, cards, carousel, forms).

### 2. Component Remixing
- Customized the default styles with subtle shadow, border-radius, and spacing.
- Combined layout ideas from multiple examples into a single cohesive design.

### 3. Responsiveness & Styling
- Used Bootstrap grid system and utility classes (`p-`, `m-`, `text-center`, `d-flex`, etc.) for layout control.
- Adjusted typography and color palette for a minimal modern appearance.

### 4. Form Integration
- Integrated **Formspree endpoint** (placeholder) to make the contact form functional.
- Added **Bootstrap client-side validation** using JavaScript.

### 5. Hosting & Deployment
- Initialized a GitHub repository and deployed the live project via **Lovable (Netlify)** for quick access.
